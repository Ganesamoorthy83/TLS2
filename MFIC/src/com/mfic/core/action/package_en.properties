ourCompany=Our Company
aboutus.p1=Alante Financial is a network of microfinance service centers in the U.S. \
		   wholly owned and operated by Microfinance International Corporation. \
		   Geographically and culturally close to our clients, Alante offers a diverse range of affordable and professional financial services in communities which banks typically do not reach.
		   
aboutus.p2=We help our clients to establish credit history, become responsible borrowers, and support their families back home. \
		   Alante prides itself in combining commercial efficiency with strong cultural awareness and social responsibility.

testimonialTitle=Maria Echeverria, a Transnational Loan Client
tm.p1=Alante Financial offers "transnational loans", which allow immigrant customers to apply and repay a loan in the US for the purchase of a home or land in their home countries.  \
	  It was found that over 50% of immigrants from Latin America are interested in purchasing a house in their home countries. \
	  Alante's network of financial institutions in Latin America, including banks and microfinance institutions, connected by ARIAS, its money transfer platform, allows the company to offer the service that meets the demands among transnational families.  \
	  Due to the transnational nature of immigrant families, customer needs vary substantially.  Alante Financial's strength stems from its ability to accommodate individual needs.
	   
tm.p2=Mrs. Maria Echeverria, a 40 year-old Salvadoran who came to the US in 1985 in the midst of the civil war, is one of Alante Financial's first transnational customers. \
	  She is repaying a loan provided by Integral, one of MFIC's partner microfinance institutions, for the purchase of a piece of land in her home town in El Salvador, where she plans to build a house and farm in the future.
	  
tm.p3=One major challenge she had was that Maria had to complete the transaction immediately. \
	  Mr. Jose Chavez, her husband's friend, needed to sell a piece of land that he owned in El Salvador to pay medical bills for his wife, who was critically ill. \
	  Maria came in to Alante Financial to discuss her application for a transnational loan to purchase the land, and flew to El Salvador the next day to visit the site and meet with Integral.
	  
tm.p4=Then, there was another hurdle.  A local property appraiser came up with a price far less than the offered price, and Integral decided to lend close to the appraisal value.\
      Having served Ms. Echeverria as a loan and remittance customer for over a year and half, Alante Financial was able to offer her a consumer loan to fill the funding gap, which enabled her to purchase the land. \
      Despite the fact that it happened during Semana Santa, a major holiday week in Latin America, Alante Financial completed the entire approval process in ten days.

tm.p5=Unlike the majority of Salvadoran immigrants, Maria has bank accounts in the US and in El Salvador, but she says that it would be very difficult for her to obtain a loan from a Salvadoran bank.\
      Moreover, being able to repay in the US makes her life much easier, she said.
      
tm.p6=Maria says she is grateful to Alante for trusting her.  She says that purchasing a house in her home country is the dream that many in her community share.\
      She hopes that Alante Financial will open more branches and extend the same services to her peers from other parts of the region.
